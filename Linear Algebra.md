Linear Algebra:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
 It is a dimensionality reduction technique used in machine learning and statistics to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while preserving most of its information.
 PCA aims to find a new set of variables (or principal components) that are linear combinations of the original variables. These new variables capture as much variance in the data as possible.
solving linear regression problems, image processing, recommendation systems.
